<title>About Our OS</title>
<h2>Background Of Our Operating System</h2>
<hr>
<h3></h3>
<p>
    Our operating system is the culmination of 6 weeks of work and >5,000 lines of code written by me: Stephen Simberg, and the BEASTS: <a href="https://coombsos.info" target="_blank">Will</a>, <a href="https://os-prokop.info" target="_blank">Jack</a>, and Manas.<br>
    This project was created and tested in the last half of our <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ECE391/sp2023/" target="_blank">Computer Systems Engineering course: ECE 391</a> at UIUC.<br>
</p>
<h3>Website Design</h3>
<p>
    The website design is based off the <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece391/" target="_blank">ECE 391 website</a> and the open source code written by the wonderful Paizhang</a>: <a href="https://github.com/stephenhsimberg/The-Best-OS/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License.</a><br>
    Check out the <a href="./overview.html" target="_blank">Technical Overview</a> to see actual work that was done. <br>
</p>
<h3>How the OS Emulation Was Made:</h3>
<p>
    This online emulation is powered by <a href="https://github.com/copy/v86" target="_blank">v86</a>.<br>
    It uses the libv86.js, seabios.bin, vgabios.bin, and v86.wasm made by the emulator, alongside our own mp3.img hard drive disk image for our operating system. <br>
